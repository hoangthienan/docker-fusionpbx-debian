Welcome to FusionPBX Docker
=========================

Usage
-----

First pull the image using the command:
```
docker pull hoangthienan/docker-fusionpbx-debian
```
Once the image has downloaded:
```
docker run --net=host --privileged --name container-name-here -d hoangthienan/docker-fusionpbx-debian
```
The placeholder container-name-here can be set to anything you like. This will start the container running, we now need to set the 
database password, to do this we need to find the container id and so we run:
```
docker ps
```
This will produce output similar to:
```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                         			COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS
017c1a7397e1        hoangthienan/docker-fusionpbx-debian    "/bin/sh -c '/usr/bin"   10 seconds ago      Up 7 seconds
```
Replacing the Container ID with our own, and substituting mypassword with an appropriate one we do:
```
docker exec 017c1a7397e1 sudo -u postgres psql -c "ALTER USER fusionpbx WITH PASSWORD 'mypassword';"
```
You will know this has been successful when it returns:
```
ALTER ROLE
```
We now need to visit the web interface to set up FusionPBX. In your browser put:
```
http://your-ip-here
```
